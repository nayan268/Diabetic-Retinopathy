# Diabetic-Retinopathy
## Perfomed channel separation and green channel enhancement with CLAHE histogram equalisation on dataset
## Classified the enhanced and orginial dataset according to severity using pre-trained VGG19 neural network
## Implemented ResNet50, DensetNet169 and DenseNet121 models, comparing performance of old and new datasets
## Implemented modified AlexNet neural network model on datasets in order to evaluate both the accuracy and the loss
## Enhanced modified AlexNet with ResNet via TensorFlow functional API, boosting accuracy from 71.71% to 76.4%
